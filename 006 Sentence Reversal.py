'''
Problem
Given a string of words, reverse all the words. For example:

Given:

'This is the best'

Return:

'best the is This'

As part of this exercise you should remove all leading and trailing whitespace. So that inputs such as:

'  space here'  and 'space here      '

both become:

'here space'
